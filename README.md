# Missing Return Statement Bug in Julia

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Julia: a missing return statement within a conditional block. The function `my_function` in `bug.jl` fails to return a value if the input `x` is 0. This leads to unexpected behavior and potentially crashes.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.jl`, addresses this issue by ensuring that a value is always returned, regardless of the input's value.
